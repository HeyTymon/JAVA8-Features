#  JAVA 8 feauters learning

## This collection of programs provides a demonstration of various features available in Java 8. The following sections briefly describe each of these topics:

- Java 8 - Streams, Lambda, Interfaces, Date/Time, Optional, Static/Default
In this folder, you will find programs created while learning various features available in Java 8. Here's a brief description of each of these topics:

- Streams
Streams is a new feature in Java 8 that allows for functional processing of data. This allows for more efficient and readable processing of large amounts of data.

- Lambda
Lambda expressions provide a concise way of representing anonymous functions in Java. They allow for more expressive and readable code.

- Interfaces
Interfaces in Java 8 have been enhanced to allow for the declaration of default methods. This allows for the addition of new methods to interfaces without breaking backward compatibility.

- Date/Time
Date/Time API in Java 8 provides a more comprehensive and flexible way of handling dates and times. It provides improved support for time zones and daylight saving time.

- Optional
Optional is a new class in Java 8 that provides a way of representing values that may or may not be present. This can help to avoid NullPointerExceptions and make code more robust.

- Static/Default
Static/Default methods in interfaces are a new feature in Java 8. They provide a way of adding utility methods to interfaces without the need for implementing classes to provide their own implementation.

Please feel free to explore the programs in this folder and experiment with these new features in Java 8.
